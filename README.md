This project is a simple game of brick breaker that I made in one of my introductory classes, where we used a custom UNH library called ‘UNH wheels’ that served as ‘training wheels’ so to speak. Basically it just gave us a list of shapes and utilities with built in methods not normally provided by Java. (http://www.cs.unh.edu/~cs415/wheelsdocs/overview-summary.html)

 

The game of brick breaker was assigned to instruct us on creating games that used collision detection as well as an introduction to animations. The main file where the application can be run is ‘Program9.java’
